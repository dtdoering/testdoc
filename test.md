This is a text document with a first line/sentence/statement/whatever that is actually quite long and should most likely span multiple lines. The purpose of this is to test out whether telling pandoc to convert Word files to markdown files without text wrapping will allow changes in single words that result in changes in line wrapping in Word can be tracked accurately on GitHub without having to do fancy stuff.
